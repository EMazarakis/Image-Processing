# Image-Processing
Two algorithms for the Optical Recognition Character (OCR) field
c++ code for X-Y cut &amp; RLSA  algorithms

The XY Cut Algorithm is a method that can be used for Page Segmentation.
The Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) is a method that can be used for Block segmentation and text discrimination.
