# Image-Processing
Two algorithms for the Optical Recognition Character (OCR) field.

C++ code for X-Y cut &amp; RLSA  algorithms using QT  as IDE.
 
The XY Cut Algorithm is a method that can be used for Page Segmentation.
The Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) is a method that can be used for Block segmentation and text discrimination.
